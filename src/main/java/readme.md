Welcome to my Grocery Store command line application!

I have designed it similar to my own experience in a grocery
store where I will either go through all the isles
in the way the store was designed, or I go only to 
the isles I need items from. 

You can add and remove items to your cart, and it will
be reflected in the quantity of items left in the isle. 

You can leave at any time and are offered a surprise 
coupon at checkout that may apply to the items you bought.

At the end, you are given a receipt that shows the items
 you bought and the total with coupons (if applicable).
